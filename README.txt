***************AdaptiveBeamConstraint**************
What it does: constrain a rigid to be attached to a beam (only in position, not the orientation)
TODO:
1- maybe find a more explicit name for the componant
2- should we also fix the orientation? and maybe allow the user to choose between both approaches
