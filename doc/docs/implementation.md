Implementation
======================= 

In the following, we describe the main components of the implementation of BeamAdapter Plugin

- [Shape function](#shape function)
- [Test](#test)



## Shape function: BeamInterpolation
One of the central component of the beams is the shape function. 
The description of the shape function relies on:
- One topology of edges
- A set of frames with Dofs (3 translations, 3 rotations) that corresponds to the points of the topology
- A spline (3d order) support for each edge


We can distinguish two cases:

# 1D structure: Wire-like objects (curvilinear abscissa can be defined)
