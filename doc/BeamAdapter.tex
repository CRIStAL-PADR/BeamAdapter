\section{Installation}

Uncomment the line $$\textbf{DEFINES += SOFA\_HAVE\_BEAMADAPTER}$$ in \textit{sofa-local.prf} (or \textit{sofa-default.prf} if you have not created \textit{sofa-local.prf}). 
Then, run qmake and make.

\section{Beam Element}
For the general introduction of beam theory and equations, see p.509~\cite{FEMBook2} .For detail of the construction local matrix, see the p.70 ~\cite{FEMBook1}.
\section{B-splines , B\'{e}zier Splines}
B-splines in general and B\'{e}zier splines in particulary can see in ~\cite{Bspline} or more detail in ~\cite{CourseGeo}. A spline tool can see at~\cite{SplineTool}. Here assumed several general formula. In general, a B\'{e}zier curve order $n$ is determined by $n+1$ control points (characteristic polygone) $P_{i,0 \leqslant i \leqslant n} $. Its trajectory is :
\[B(t) = \sum_{i=0}^n \hat{\textbf{B}} _{i,n}(t) . P_i   \]
Where $\hat{\textbf{B}} _{i,n}(t)$ are Bernstein polynomial given by 
\[\hat{\textbf{B}} _{i,n}(t) =  \binom{n}{i} .t^i.(1-t)^{n-i}  \]
The most usually used is the cubic B\'{e}zier , where trajectory is given by  
\[(1-t)^3.P_0    + 3.(1-t)^2 t.P_1    +   3.t^2(1-t).P_3   +  t^3.P_3\]

\subsection{WireRestShape}

Define the rest shape of a wire.

The data \textit{procedural} defines if the rest shape is generated procedurally, or loaded from a file with the data \textit{filename}. 
It is possible to scale the rest shape loaded from a file with the parameter \textit{nonProceduralScale}.
The wire has a total length defined in \textit{length}.

The procedural rest shape is composed of a straight segment with a spring-like shape on the tip.
These shapes are defined with the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{straightLength} : length of the straight segment
  \item \textit{spireDiameter} : spring diameter
  \item \textit{spireHeight} : spring height
\end{itemize}


The component will implicitly get a \textbf{sofa::core::topology::TopologyContainer} to build the rest shape topology, with a \textbf{sofa::component::topology::EdgeSetGeometryAlgorithms} and a \textbf{sofa::~component::~topology::EdgeSetTopologyModifier}, generally in the same node in the scene graph.

\subsection{BeamInterpolation }

Describe the interpolation between the two frames of a beam. It is based on B\'ezier splines.

The component needs a \textbf{sofa::core::topology::BaseMeshTopology} to work on it.
